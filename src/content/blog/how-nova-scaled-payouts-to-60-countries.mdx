## The Challenge

Nova went from paying a handful of vendors in Europe to thousands of partners worldwide—fast. Their pains:

- 5+ banking portals, each with different cut-off times
- Manual FX conversions and opaque fees
- Week-long reconciliation cycles every month end

## The Solution

Nova plugged our treasury API into their payout engine:

- **Virtual accounts** per market to segregate flows
- **Automated FX** rules (bulk conversions at preferred rate windows)
- **Real-time webhooks** to update their ERP (no more CSV uploads)

## Results

- **60→2 hours** to reconcile monthly payouts
- **~35 bps** saved on average FX costs
- **95% fewer** failed or delayed payments (thanks to validation + alerts)

> “We didn’t just speed things up—we actually trust our cash positions now.” — _Jenna Patel_

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1–2:** Map current bank feeds & design target flow
2. **Week 3–4:** Stand up multi-currency wallets and virtual accounts
3. **Week 5:** Ship webhook listeners & reconciliation rules
4. **Week 6:** Turn on automation, monitor exceptions only

## Lessons Learned

- Define ownership: Ops vs Finance vs Engineering.
- Start with the top three corridors; generalize later.
- Get alerts in the tools your team actually watches (Slack/Teams).
