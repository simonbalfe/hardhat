## Our Threat Model

We assume credentials can leak, endpoints will be probed, and supply chains get attacked. Everything we build is designed to limit blast radius and detect anomalies early.

## Data Isolation by Design

- **Single-tenant logical separation**: each customer gets isolated schemas and keys.
- **Scoped service accounts**: microservices can only touch the data they absolutely need.
- **Row-level ACLs** for internal tooling—no blanket read access.

## Encryption Everywhere

- **At rest:** AES-256 with envelope encryption; keys in HSM-backed KMS (rotated regularly).
- **In transit:** TLS 1.3 enforced; mTLS for service-to-service traffic.
- **Field-level encryption** for especially sensitive attributes (PII, banking details).

## Secrets & Key Management

- Stored in a dedicated secrets manager with strict RBAC and audit trails.
- Short-lived credentials via OIDC flows; no long-lived API keys in code.
- Build pipeline signs artifacts; production only runs signed images.

## Continuous Monitoring & Response

- Centralized logs → anomaly detection (ML + rule-based).
- Immutable audit trails with cryptographic proofs.
- 24/7 alerting with on-call rotation and documented runbooks.
