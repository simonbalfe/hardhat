## Why This Matters

Managing balances across currencies normally means juggling multiple bank portals, delays, and painful FX fees. We wanted to make “open account → move money” feel instant—and transparent.

## What We Shipped

- **Instant wallets** in EUR, GBP, and USD (more coming).
- **Interbank FX rates** with a small, visible markup—no surprises.
- **Unified ledger**: every currency shows up in one dashboard with real-time balances.
- **Rule-based sweeps** between currencies (e.g., keep €50k buffer, convert excess to USD).

## How It Works

1. Click **“Create Wallet”** → choose currency.
2. Get account details (IBAN, sort code, routing number) immediately.
3. Receive/send funds like any domestic account.
4. Convert on demand or via automated rules.

> Tip: Set alerts for when your EUR balance crosses a threshold so you auto-convert to USD and lock in target rates.

## Pricing & Limits

- No monthly fee for wallets.
- FX: transparent spread shown before you confirm.
- Tiered volume discounts for high-frequency treasury moves.

## What’s Next

- JPY, AUD, and CAD wallets.
- Bulk FX orders and time-weighted average price (TWAP) execution.
- API endpoints to open/close wallets programmatically.
